## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tablesalt'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tablesalt

## Usage

### ClassPass

Utility for creating single-ingress service objects.

```ruby
class MyClass
  class << self
    def call(foo:, bar:)
      new(foo: foo, bar: bar).call
    end
  end
  
  def call
    ...
end

# Can be rewritten as:
class MyClass
  include ClassPass
  
  class_pass_method :call
  
  def call
    ...
end
```

#### Blocks
Blocks passed to class pass methods will be passed to the instance method being called, *not* initialize.
```ruby
class MyClass
  include Tablesalt::ClassPass
  class_pass_method :call
  
  def initialize(a)
    @a = a
    yield "called from initialize" if block_given?
  end
    
  def call
    yield "called from call" if block_given?
  end
end

MyClass.call(nil) { |str| puts str }
"called from call"
```

### ThreadAccessor

In the simplest use case, a ThreadAccessor can be used to set a value on the current working thread to be used later on. The `thread_accessor` method creates a singleton and instance method for reading and writing a given variable stored on the thread.

#### Defined methods
* `thread_reader(method_name, thread_key = method_name, private: true)`
  Defines singleton method and instance method to read from the given thread key.
* `thread_writer(method_name, thread_key = method_name, private: true)`
  Defines singleton method and instance method to write to the given thread key.
* `thread_accessor(method_name, thread_key = method_name, private: true)`
  Calls `thread_reader` and `thread_writer` with the given arguments.
  
#### Example

```ruby
class CurrentUser
  include TableSalt::ThreadAccessor

  thread_accessor :current_user

  def self.set(user)
    self.current_user = user
  end
end

CurrentUser.set(User.first)

# then, sometime later within the same request:
CurrentUser.current_user
# => #<User id: 1>
```

#### Thread Safety
Yep, when you mess with thread variables, you need to think about thread safety. For Rack applications, `ThreadAccessor` ships with a Rack middleware component:
```ruby
# in config/initializers/rack.rb, or config/initializers/tablesalt.rb, or anywhere else in your boot path:
Rails.application.config.middleware.use Tablesalt::ThreadAccessor::RackMiddleware
```

If your application isn't on Rack, you'll need to add a little more code manually to take care of this:
```ruby
# Somewhere in your request path:
class YourMiddleware
  def call
    ThreadAccessor.clean_thread_context { yield }
  end
end
```

#### Namespaces

Maybe you wrote a gem that, say, sets a current user value on the thread to enable some other cool behavior. Since you don't want your gem's behavior to interfere with other behavior of the application, you can use a namespaced thread store instead:
```ruby
module MyGem
  class CurrentUser
    # This isolates the module's thread store for your gem. 
    include Tablesalt::ThreadAccessor[MyGem]

    thread_accessor :current_user

    def self.set(user)
      self.current_user = user
    end
  end

  class DoAThing
    include Tablesalt::ThreadAccessor[MyGem]
    
    thread_accessor :current_user
  end
end

MyGem::CurrentUser.set(User.first)

# then, sometime later within the same request:
MyGem::DoAThing.current_user
# => #<User id: 1>

# From class defined above:
CurrentUser.current_user
# => nil
```

Note that this will require you to clear your gem's thread store manually. It is recommended you provide your own middleware with your gem to keep the application's thread stores clean:

```ruby
module MyGem
  class MyMiddleware
    def initialize(app)
      @app = app
    end

    def call(req)
      ThreadAccessor.clean_thread_context(namespace: MyGem) { @app.call(req) }
    end
  end
end
```

#### Test Helpers

Tablesalt's spec helper provides custom RSpec matchers for thread accessor methods:
* `defines_thread_accessor(name, thread_key, private: true, namespace: nil)`
* `defines_thread_reader(name, thread_key, private: true, namespace: nil)`
* `defines_thread_writer(name, thread_key, private: true, namespace: nil)`

If your application uses ThreadAccessor, you'll need to clear the thread stores between test runs. 
* **RSpec**
  If you're using RSpec, you're in luck! Just `require tablesalt/spec_helper` in `spec_helper.rb` or `rails_helper.rb`.
* **Minitest & others**
  If you're using Minitest or some other testing framework, you'll need to clear things out manually. This is pretty simple, just run the following after each test run:
  ```ruby
  Thread.current[Tablesalt::ThreadAccessor::THREAD_ACCESSOR_STORE_THREAD_KEY] = nil
  ```
