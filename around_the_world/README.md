## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "around_the_world"
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install around_the_world
```

## Usage

Define a method that gets called _around_ the given instance method:

```ruby
class SomeClass
  include AroundTheWorld

  def make_something_happen!
    @something_happened = true
  end
  
  def did_something_happened?
    !!@something_happened
  end
  
  around_method :make_something_happen!, :did_something_happened? do |..|
    things_happened = super(...)

    if things_happened
      "Something happened!"
    else
      "Nothing to see here..."
    end
  end
end
```

```
> SomeClass.new.did_something_happened?
=> "Nothing to see here..."

> SomeClass.new.make_something_happen!
=> "Something happened!"

> SomeClass.new.did_something_happened?
=> "Something happened!"
```

`around_method` accepts an option hash `prevent_double_wrapping_for: [Object]`. If defined, this prevents wrapping the method twice for a given purpose. It accepts any value:


```ruby
class SomeClass
  include AroundTheWorld

  def some_method
    "method behavior"
  end

  around_method :some_method, prevent_double_wrapping_for: :memoization do |...|
    @memoized ||= super(...)
  end

  around_method :some_method, prevent_double_wrapping_for: :memoization do |...|
    @memoized ||= super(...)
  end
end
```

Results in:

```
# => AroundTheWorld::DoubleWrapError:
     "Module AroundTheWorld:ProxyModule:memoization already defines the method :some_method"
```

It works for class methods too:

```ruby
class SomeClass
  class << self
    include AroundTheWorld

    def a_singleton_method; end

    around_method :a_singleton_method do |...|
      super(...)

      "It works for class methods too!"
    end
  end
end
```

```
> SomeClass.a_singleton_method
=> "It works for class methods too!"
```
